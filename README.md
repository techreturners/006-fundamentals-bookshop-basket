# Stock Manager Exercises

In this set of exercises, we introduce a stock manager.

The purpose of the stock manager is to maintain and provide information on the stock of books we have in the bookstore.

# Tasks

# 1) Understand Javascript arrays

The [stockmanager.js](./app/stockmanager.js) file introduces a new concept we haven't come across yet. 

It introduces a [Javascript array](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md#arrays) called `stockOfBooks`.

Read the following information on Arrays:

# 2) Fork this repo

Fork this repository in to your own GitHub account.

# 3) Clone the repo down to your laptop

Once you have forked your repository you should be able to clone it from your own account by replacing the YOURUSERNAME part with your actual GitHub username.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/005-fundamentals-stock-example.git
```


# 4) Review and run the tests

There are three tests in the [stockmanager.test.js](./test/stockmanager.test.js).

The tests are currently failing because the implementations have not yet been written.

In order to run the tests you do:

```
npm install
```

NOTE: You only need to run `npm install` once, after first cloning.

and then do 

```
npm test
```

# 5) Implement the functions required for the tests to pass

After reviewing the failing tests go ahead and start implementing the functions in the stockmanager.js file.

**NOTE**

Don't forget to save and COMMIT - little and often. This helps us see your working. Once you are happy with your code PUSH it up to your GitRepo and drop us a Slack message to review and feedback.
